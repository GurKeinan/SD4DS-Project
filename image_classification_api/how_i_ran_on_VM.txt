In this file I detail the steps needed to run
the image classification API on our VM without building it
on the VM itself, but rather building on the personal laptop.

docker-compose build
docker save -o to_remote_image.tar image_classification_api-web
gzip to_remote_image.tar  # zip the .tar file
scp to_remote_image.tar.gz student@<IP address>:
scp docker-compose-for-remote.yml student@<IP address>:

# scp means secure copy, it is like ssh but for copying files
# the IP address changes every time you start the VM

ssh student@<IP address>
###### on the VM
gunzip to_remote_image.tar.gz
docker load -i to_remote_image.tar
mv docker-compose-for-remote.yml docker-compose.yml


# and finally, run by:
#docker-compose run web <command to be executed in the container>
# for example:

docker compose run web python -m tests.post_upload_image
