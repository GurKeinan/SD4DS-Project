In this file I detail the steps needed to run
the image classification API on our VM without building it
on the VM itself, but rather building on the personal laptop.

docker-compose build

NOW PUSH THE IMAGE TO DOCKERHUB

CONNECT TO THE VM BY:
ssh student@<IP address>

PULL THE IMAGE FROM DOCKERHUB ON THE VM

# and finally, run by:
#docker-compose run web <command to be executed in the container>
# for example:

docker compose run web python -m tests.test_post_upload_image

OR:

docker compose run web python -m unittest discover   # to run all tests
